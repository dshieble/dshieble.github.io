Hi, I'm Dan Shiebler. I'm a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Twitter Cortex](https://cortex.twitter.com/en.html) in New York. My work focuses on developing systems and models to improve the performance and efficiency of Machine Learning at Twitter. I Tweet at [@dshieble](https://twitter.com/dshieble).

I'm also a (remote) PhD student at the University of Oxford. My research focuses on applications of Category Theory to Machine Learning. I am jointly advised by [Jeremy Gibbons](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/jeremy.gibbons/) and [Cezar Ionescu](https://www.th-deg.de/en/Cezar-Ionescu-Fakult%C3%A4t%20Angewandte%20Informatik-Professoren/-innen-1975).

Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist at [TrueMotion](https://gotruemotion.com/) in Boston. Before that, I studied Computer Science and Neuroscience at Brown University. I've also spent some time doing Computational Vision research with the [Serre Lab](http://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/) and Neurosurgery research with the [Asaad Lab](https://www.brown.edu/Research/asaad/). My [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-shiebler-10219b42/) and [github](https://github.com/dshieble) are usually somewhat up-to-date.

In my spare time I like to read fantasy novels and non-fiction, play guitar terribly, ride my bicycle, hike, and travel.
