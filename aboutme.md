Hi, I'm Dan Shiebler. I'm a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Twitter Cortex](https://cortex.twitter.com/en.html) in New York. I'm also a (remote) PhD student at the University of Oxford. My research focuses on applications of Category Theory to Machine Learning.

Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist at [TrueMotion](https://gotruemotion.com/) in Boston. Before that, I studied Computer Science and Neuroscience at Brown University. My [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-shiebler-10219b42/) is usually somewhat up-to-date. 

In my spare time I like to read fantasy novels and non-fiction, play guitar terribly, ride my bicycle, hike, and travel.
