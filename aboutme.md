Hi, I'm Dan Shiebler. I work as a Data Scientist at [TrueMotion](https://gotruemotion.com/) in Boston. We determine driver risk from smart phone sensor data. Every day I get to research, design and implement machine learning algorithms. That's pretty awesome. 

In my spare time I like to learn about math and programming, ride my bicycle, hike, practice Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and travel.
