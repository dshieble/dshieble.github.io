Hi, I'm Dan Shiebler. I work as a Data Scientist at TrueMotion. Every day I get to research, design and implement machine learning algorithms that determine driver risk from smart phone sensor data, which is pretty awesome. 

In my spare time I like to learn about math and programming, ride my bicycle, hike, and practice Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
