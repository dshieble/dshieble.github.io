Hi, I'm Dan Shiebler. I like math, programming, history, nature, art and travel. I live in NYC.

I'm currently building something new at the intersection of AI and cybersecurity.

I previously served as the Head of Machine Learning at [Abnormal AI](https://abnormal.ai), where I held the overall responsibility for detection efficacy and oversaw all AI/ML initiatives as the company scaled to $300M ARR.

Before Abnormal I spent almost 5 years working at Twitter — first as a Staff ML Engineer on the Cortex team, where we built Twitter’s core embedding and vector search capabilities, and later as the Engineering Manager for the web ads ML team, where we launched ML model improvements that drove a $100M+ increase in Twitter revenue.

While working full time at Twitter I started and completed a PhD (DPhil) at the University of Oxford. My research introduced novel perspectives on unsupervised learning and optimization algorithms. You can find my dissertation [here](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:ec72e338-d95e-4bd6-9412-7ac76b7ddc15).

Earlier in my career I worked as a Senior Data Scientist at TrueMotion, where I designed many of the patented sensor data analytics algorithms that contributed to TrueMotion’s $650M+ acquisition.

I completed Bachelors degrees with honors in Neuroscience and Computer Science at Brown University.
