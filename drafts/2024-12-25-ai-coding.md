Modalities of AI
- autocomplete
- chat and investigation
- composition

Making the Most of AI
- Docs, Tests, Tools
- Generating tests, especially integration tests that require lots of upfront data generation
- Scripts, cli tools, and GUIs are easier to generate than ever
- Use the right kinds of types (datetimes, dataclasses instead of dictionaries, etc)

Tips
- Generate tests at the same time as code
- Context window management is critical, organize code to place relevant context as close together as possible
- Decisions should be as context-independent as possible
