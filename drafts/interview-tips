Scope of this post:
- Interviews for experienced technical roles
- Especially ML Engineering, but this is mostly applicable to any technical role


The Interviewer Perspective
- Key personas
  - The hiring manager
    - They want the role to get filled ASAP
    - They generally make the final decision (unless something is broken, such as a micromanaging higher up or impending reorg) 
    - They will generally defer to technical interviewers who give a strong no
  - The close teammate in the same role
    - They want someone who they can count on
    - They may or may not be incentivized to get the role filled depending on the role and the company
    - They will generally ask questions that are role-relevant
  - The trusted interviewer
    - They are somewhat uninvested in the outcome and will be the least biased
    - They will be the most mechanical, and will generally hold candidates most closely to a rubric

- The Rubric
  - The interviewer is likely looking at a document describing what scores to give you based on what you say
  - If the interviewer doesn't hear you say something, they will often ask follow up questions to give you the chance to say it


Key Tips:
- Brevity is key, never speak for more than 120 seconds in a row (and less than 60 is ideal). This lets you avoid the worst case scenario where the interviewer is looking for something specific and you are talking about something else - both annoying them and preventing yourself from getting credit for what you actually know
- If you know something well, don't jump into adding lots of irrelevant details immediately. Instead tell the interviewer that you could talk about the topic in much more detail and move on unless they prod you to do so.
- Listen carefully to the interviewer, they are probably trying to get you to say something that they can give you points for
