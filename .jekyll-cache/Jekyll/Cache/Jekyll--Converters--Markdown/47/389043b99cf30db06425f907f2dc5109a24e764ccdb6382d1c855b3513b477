<p>One of my favorite classes in college was Abstract Algebra. It was my first non-CS non-elementary math class, and I took it because I knew I didn‚Äôt want to graduate without having broadened my mathematical horizons beyond CS.</p>

<p>As it turned out, Abstract Algebra felt pretty familiar. Many of the constructs we form and play with in Algebra underlie many CS fields, such as crytography and graph theory. There is also a lot of overlap between the tools used in Algebra and CS, such as homo/isomorphisms.</p>

<h3 id="mathematical-structures">Mathematical Structures</h3>

<p>Many mathematical fields share a common theme - define some structures (often types of sets) then prove things about them. In Computation Theory, the structures are automata and languages. In Calculus/Real Analysis, the structures are continuous, differentiable, riemann-integrable, etc real valued functions of real variables. In Abstract Algebra, the structures are groups, rings and fields.</p>

<p>There are some similarities between mathematical structures and the classes of object-oriented programming. Often we study general structures that must obey some axiom, and then define ‚Äúsubclasses‚Äù of those structures that obey additional axioms. For example, rings are subclasses of groups - they satisfy all of the same axioms, but they add an additional operation and some additional structure.</p>

<p>Why do we spend the effort developing and proving theorems about general mathematical structures? For the same reason that we define classes and subclasses rather than build each object seperately - to minimize redundancy and reduce complexity. When we‚Äôve proven a theorem about a particular structure, then that theorem applies to everything with that structure. If we define a new structure as a special case of a parent structure, then all of the work that we‚Äôve done to understand the parent structure applies to the child structure as well.</p>

<p>Consider writing a program in Java where you define a method that accepts a ‚Äúfoo.‚Äù Then you can write that function with the certainty that anything passed in will have access to all of foo‚Äôs methods. When we write a proof about groups it‚Äôs the same idea - regardless of the inner workings of the infinite different groups, we know that as long as we build the proof on the group axioms it will hold for all groups.</p>

<h3 id="the-group">The Group</h3>

<p>One basic structure in Abstract Algebra is the group. A group is a set, which we will denote by \(G\), combined with a ‚Äúgroup operation,‚Äù which we will denote by \(*\), that satisfies the following axioms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For all \(a,b\) in \(G\), \(a*b\) is also an element in \(G\) (\(G\) is closed under \(*\))</li>
  <li>For all \(a,b,c\) in \(G\), \((a*b)*c = a*(b*c)\) (\(*\) is associative)</li>
  <li>There is an identity element \(1\) in \(G\) such that \(a*1 = 1*a = a\)</li>
  <li>For all \(a\) in \(G\), there is a \(b\) in \(G\) such that \(a*b = b*a = 1\) (every element in \(G\) has an inverse)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that this definition does not require that \(*\) be commutative, that is, for many groups \(a*b \neq b*a\). Groups where \(*\) is commutative are called ‚Äúabelian‚Äù groups.</p>

<h3 id="examples-of-groups">Examples of Groups</h3>

<p>Groups are everywhere in mathematics, and you‚Äôve probably worked with many groups in the past without realizing it.</p>

<h4 id="example-1-integers-and-addition">Example 1: Integers and Addition</h4>

<p>The integers (\(G\)) and the addition operation (lets use \(+\) rather than \(*\) for clarity) form a group. Let‚Äôs prove it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The sum of two integers is an integer, so \(G\) is closed under \(+\).</li>
  <li>Addition is associative</li>
  <li>For any integer, \(a\), \(a + 0 = 0 + a = a\), so \(0\) is the identity element.</li>
  <li>For any integer, \(a\), \(a + -a = 0\).</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the integers and the multiplication operation don‚Äôt form a group, since the multiplicative inverses of integers are usually not integers (they are rational numbers). However‚Ä¶</p>

<h4 id="example-2-integers-and-multiplication-modulo-p">Example 2: Integers and Multiplication modulo \(P\)</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you haven‚Äôt encountered modular arithmetic before, there is a great introduction <a href="https://www.artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Modular_arithmetic/Introduction">here</a>. As a refresher, \(x\) \(mod\) \(n\) is the remainder of \(x/n\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of the astute readers might now be asking ‚Äúwhat about modular arithmetic? Do the integers and multiplication modulo \(n\) form a group?‚Äù This is a great question, and the answer is ‚Äúsometimes.‚Äù</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs consider the integers \(1...n-1\) and the operation multiplication modulo \(n\). For two integers \(a, b\), \(a*b\) \(mod\) \(n\) must be less than \(n\). Since \(a*b\) \(mod\) \(n\) is only \(0\) when \(a*b\) is divisible by \(n\), then as long as \(n\) is prime, \(a*b\) \(mod\) \(n\) will be in \(1...n-1\).</p>

<p>That proves the closure condition (condition 1). For the other 3 conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Multiplication is associative</li>
  <li>For any integer, \(a\), \(a * 1 = 1 * a = a\), so \(1\) is the identity element.</li>
  <li>The proof of the existence of multiplicative inverses is a little complicated and relies on Bezel‚Äôs theorem, you can find it <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/780189/proof-that-the-multiplicative-group-of-integers-modulo-n-is-a-group">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore the set of integers \(1...n-1\) and the multiplication modulo \(n\) operation form a group if \(n\) is prime.</p>

<h4 id="example-3-rotations-of-a-square-and-cyclic-groups">Example 3: Rotations of a square (and cyclic groups)</h4>

<p>Let‚Äôs step away from numbers for a moment. The ‚Äúrotational symmetries‚Äù of a polygon are the different mappings of the polygon to itself by rotation. Consider some triangle \(ABC\). We can enumerate the rotational symmetries of \(ABC\) by sequentially rotating \(ABC\) by \(120\) degrees. Lets denote ‚Äúno rotation‚Äù of \(ABC\) as \(r^0\) or \(1\), and \(n\) rotations of \(ABC\) as \(r^n\).</p>

<p>This is \(1\):
<img src="/img/triangle.png" alt="Not rotated" /></p>

<p>This is \(r\):
<img src="/img/triangle2.png" alt="Rotated once" /></p>

<p>This is \(r^2\)
<img src="/img/triangle3.png" alt="Rotated twice" /></p>

<p>Note that \(r^3 = r\). Now, lets prove that the set of rotational symmetries of \(ABC\) along with the rotation operation forms a group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If we rotate \(ABC\) \(a\) times, and then rotate it \(b\) times, this is the same as rotating \(ABC\) \(a+b\) times, so \(r^a * r^b = r^{a+b}\), and the closure condition holds.</li>
  <li>Since the order of rotations doesn‚Äôt matter, the associativity condition holds.</li>
  <li>Since the ‚Äúno rotation‚Äù element does not change the orientation of \(ABC\), then \(1\) is the identity element.</li>
  <li>Since we can always rotate any rotational symmetry of \(ABC\) back to the original orientation, (i.e. \(r*r^{2} = 1\) and \(r^{2}*r = 1\)), each element has an inverse.</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that the proof above applies to more than just \(ABC\) - it applies to any regular polygon.</p>
