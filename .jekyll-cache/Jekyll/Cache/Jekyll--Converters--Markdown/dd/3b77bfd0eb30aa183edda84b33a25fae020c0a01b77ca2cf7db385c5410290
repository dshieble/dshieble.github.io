<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Dan Shiebler. I live in NYC and lead the Web Ads Machine Learning team at Twitter. Previously, I worked as a Staff Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="https://cortex.twitter.com/en.html">Twitter Cortex</a>, where I focused on developing systems and models to improve the performance and efficiency of Machine Learning at Twitter. I Tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/dshieble">@dshieble</a>.</p>

<p>Before that, I worked as a Senior Data Scientist at <a href="https://gotruemotion.com/">TrueMotion</a> in Boston. Before that, I studied Computer Science and Neuroscience at Brown University. Iâ€™ve also spent some time doing Computational Vision research with the <a href="http://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/">Serre Lab</a> and Neurosurgery research with the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/Research/asaad/">Asaad Lab</a>. My <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-shiebler-10219b42/">linkedin</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dshieble">github</a> are usually somewhat up-to-date.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m also a (remote) PhD student at the University of Oxford. My research focuses on applications of Category Theory to Machine Learning. I am jointly advised by <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/jeremy.gibbons/">Jeremy Gibbons</a> and <a href="https://www.th-deg.de/en/Cezar-Ionescu-Fakult%C3%A4t%20Angewandte%20Informatik-Professoren/-innen-1975">Cezar Ionescu</a>.</p>

<p>In my spare time I like to read fantasy novels and non-fiction, play guitar terribly, ride my bicycle, hike, and travel.</p>
