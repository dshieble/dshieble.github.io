Asynchronous written communication is eating the world. Critical ideas, discussions and decisions are increasingly mediated through platforms like Email, Slack, and Docs. How can we ensure this communication is effective?

Words and sentences can vary widely in meaning, and the bedrock of effective communication is shared context. In a conversation context can be transferred through facial expressions and body language - this is not possible in written communication. We must increase the specificity of our written communication to be reliably understood.

For example, suppose that last Tuesday Bob said X to you and Sara. If you send Sara a message that says:

> I think Bob might have been wrong, and the opposite is true instead

Then it is quite possible that Sara will misunderstand you. Perhaps Sara has had several conversations with Bob and she doesn't know which of the many things Bob has said that you are referring to. Furthermore, perhaps Sara and you have different conceptions of which conclusion is the "opposite" of what Bob said.

Sara is much more likely to understand a message along the lines of:

> I think Bob might have been wrong when he suggested increasing the timeout threshold, and we should decrease it instead

Both messages have the same meaning, but the latter is far harder to misinterpret. By explicitly specifying Bob's opinion (we should increase the timeout threshold) and the conclusion (we should decrease the timeout threshold), the second message closes the primary ambiguities that could have led to Sara's confusion.

By increasing the specificity of our async written communication we can significantly improve its understandability.
