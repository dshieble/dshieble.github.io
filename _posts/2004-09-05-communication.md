Async written communication is eating the world. A growing percentage of critical ideas, discussions and decisions are mediated through platforms like Email, Slack, and Docs. How can we ensure this communication is effective?

Words and sentences can vary widely in meaning, and the bedrock of effective communication is shared context. In a conversation context can be transferred through facial expressions and body language - this is not possible in written communication. We must hold written communication to a much higher bar of specificity to achieve the same level of effectiveness. 

For example, suppose that last Tuesday Bob said X to you and Sara. If you send Sara an email that says 
> I think Bob might have been wrong, and the opposite is true instead
then it is quite possible that Sara will misunderstand you. Perhaps Sara has had several conversations with Bob that you were not a part of and she doesn't know which of his many opinions you are referring to. She is much more likely to understand an email along the lines of:

> I think Bob might have been wrong when he said X to us last Tuesday in the ABC meeting, and Y is true instead

Both messages have the same meaning, but the latter is far harder to misinterpret. The original message left implicit both the subject (what Bob said) and the conclusion (that the opposite of what Bob said, Y, is what we should conclude). The second message made both of these explicit instead.  

By increasing the specificity of our async written communication we can significantly improve its understandability.

There are two core strategies at play - tailoring communication to the audience and avoiding underspecification. 


By switching the frame of reference to the

 saying "I think Bob was right" you can instead say "When Bob told us X last week, I think he was right".

A corollary to this is that communication must be tailored to the audience. 


- understand who you are speaking to
- provide context
- anticipate misunderstanding, be as specific as necessary

often with individuals who may not share a native language.
Remote and async communication have exploded, workplaces have become increasingly culturally and lingually diverse, and modern media has eroded our collective attention span. 

In the face of these headwinds its worth asking - how can I ensure that I am understood when I speak or write? This is important for everyone, but especially critical for people who need to communicate complex (especially technical) concepts in their work.

Let's be clear on one thing first - this is a guide to being understood, and not for writing or speaking well in general. Good communication is understandable but not necessarily interesting or entertaining. 



Effective communication is harder than ever.

Let's be clear on one thing first - this is a guide to being understood, and not for writing or speaking well in general. Good communication is understandable but not necessarily interesting or entertaining. 

The bedrock of effective communication is context. The easiest way to be misunderstood in a world of async communication is to assume that the person you are speaking to has exactly the same context as you.

For example, suppose that last Tuesday Bob said X to you and Sara. If you send Sara an email that says 
```
I think Bob might have been wrong, and the opposite is true instead
```
then it is quite possible that Sara will misunderstand you. Perhaps Sara has had several conversations with Bob that you were not a part of and she doesn't know which of his many opinions you are referring to. She is much more likely to understand an email along the lines of
```
I think Bob might have been wrong when he said X to us last Tuesday in the ABC meeting, and Y is true instead
```

Both messages have the same meaning, but the latter is far harder to misinterpret. By tailoring the communication to the audience and increasing  specificity it's possible to cut down significantly on possible misunderstandings.

Talking in person is hard enough, but when so much critical communication happens on low bandwidth video calls or written formats like email/slack/teams the bar is hi


Our remote-first world places a higher bar on good communication

Reduction of shared cultural context

Reduced attention spans
