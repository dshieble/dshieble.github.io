Asynchronous written communication is eating the world. Critical ideas, discussions and decisions are increasingly mediated through platforms like Email, Slack, and Docs. How can we ensure this communication is effective?

Words and sentences can vary widely in meaning, and the bedrock of effective communication is shared context. In a conversation context can be transferred through facial expressions and body language - this is not possible in written communication. We must increase the specificity of our written communication to be reliably understood.

For example, suppose that last Tuesday Bob said X to you and Sara. If you send Sara an email that says:

> I think Bob might have been wrong, and the opposite is true instead

Then it is quite possible that Sara will misunderstand you. Perhaps Sara has had several conversations with Bob and she doesn't know which of his many opinions you are referring to. She is much more likely to understand an email along the lines of:

> I think Bob might have been wrong when he said X to us last Tuesday in the ABC meeting, and the opposite, Y, is true instead

Both messages have the same meaning, but the latter is far harder to misinterpret. The original message left implicit both the subject (what Bob said) and the conclusion (that the opposite of what Bob said, Y, is what we should conclude). The second message made both of these explicit instead.  

By increasing the specificity of our async written communication we can significantly improve its understandability.
