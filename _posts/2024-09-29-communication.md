Asynchronous written communication is eating the world. Critical ideas, discussions and decisions are increasingly mediated through platforms like Email, Slack, and Docs - often between individuals who do not share a native language. How can we ensure this communication is effective?

In written communication, ambiguity can quickly derail a conversation. Without body language or tone of voice to clarify intent, even small misunderstandings can lead to project delays or confusion. We must increase the specificity of our written communication to be reliably understood.

For example, suppose that last Tuesday Bob suggested to you and Sara that the team increase the timeout threshold in a critical API call. If you send Sara a message that says:

> I think Bob might have been wrong. We should do the opposite.

Then it is quite possible that Sara will misunderstand you. Perhaps Sara has had several conversations with Bob and she doesn't know which of the many things Bob has said that you are referring to. Furthermore, perhaps Sara and you have different conceptions of which conclusion is the "opposite" of what Bob said.

Sara is much more likely to understand a message along the lines of:

> I think Bob might have been wrong when he suggested increasing the timeout threshold. We should decrease it instead.

Both messages have the same meaning, but the latter is far harder to misinterpret. By explicitly specifying Bob's opinion (we should increase the timeout threshold) and the conclusion (we should decrease the timeout threshold), the second message closes the primary ambiguities that could have led to Sara's confusion.

Next time you're writing an email or Slack message, pause to ask yourself: How could the person reading this misunderstand what I am saying? How could I add specificity to remove this possibility? By explicitly specifying key details, you'll minimize confusion and have more productive conversations.
