        <title>An Introduction to Algebraic Groups for CS People</title>
        <description>
          
          One of my favorite classes in college was Abstract Algebra. It was my first non-CS non-elementary math class, and I took it because I knew I didn’t want to graduate without having broadened my mathematical horizons beyond CS. As it turned out, Abstract Algebra felt pretty familiar. Many of the...

        <title>Computation Theory Part 2 - Complexity Classes and NP Completeness</title>
        <description>
          
          Welcome to part 2 of the Computation Theory series! In the last post, we discussed decidability and the halting problem. In this post we will talk about complexity classes. Time Complexity If you’re not used to reasoning about algorithms and their complexity, there is an enormous amount of great material...

        <title>Computation Theory Part 1 - The Halting Problem</title>
        <description>
          
          When you think about the most important fields of mathematics for a data scientist to know, you’ll almost certainly name calculus, probability/statistics, and linear algebra. These fields form the underpinnings of the most popular data analysis, signal processing and machine learning techniques. But in my experience, I’ve found that there...

        <title>Parallel Progress Bar - An easy way to run parallel jobs in python</title>
        <description>
          
          In this post I’m going to share a simple method that will turn any list comprehension into a high performance parallel job with a progress bar. tqdm If you are a python programmer who hasn’t worked with tqdm before, I’m about to change your life. With just 6 characters, tqdm...

        <title>Musical TensorFlow, Part 2 - How to build an RNN-RBM for longer musical compositions in TensorFlow</title>
        <description>
          
          Welcome to part 2 of the Musical TensorFlow series! In the last post, we built an RBM in TensorFlow for making short pieces of music. Today, we’re going to learn how to compose longer and more complex musical pieces with a more involved model: the RNN-RBM. To warm you up,...

        <title>Musical TensorFlow, Part 1 - How to build an RBM in TensorFlow for making music</title>
        <description>
          
          Generative models are awesome. TensorFlow is awesome. Music is awesome. In this post, we’re going to use TensorFlow to build a generative model that can create snippets of music. I’m going to assume that you have a pretty good understanding of neural networks and backpropagation and are at least a...
